abstract = {This paper presents a differentiable pipeline for topology optimization of high-resolution mechanical metamaterials on grid domains, enabling complete geometric freedom within a fixed-resolution design space. Our method begins with a microstructure generation procedure based on random walks, which avoids hand-crafted parameterizations and populates the design space without strong geometric priors, yielding a diverse set of mechanically meaningful microstructures. We train a convolutional neural network to predict homogenized stiffness tensors from these microstructures, enabling a fast and differentiable approximation of mechanical behavior without the need for finite element solves. By plugging this surrogate into a topology optimization loop, we can backpropagate through mechanical objectives and discover high-resolution, fabricable designs across a wide range of densities and target behaviors. We demonstrate our pipeline’s inverse design capabilities, producing microstructures with both isotropic and anisotropic stiffness, and validate our predictions through mechanical testing.},
